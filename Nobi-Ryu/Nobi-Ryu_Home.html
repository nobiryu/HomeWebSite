    	<h1>Founding</h1>
        <p>
        	Society of Japanese Blade Arts and the system of Nobi Ryu Hajutsu was started after the founder John Thacker was asked by Brent Kammen if he could teach him the sword as well. John had already been teaching Anthony Thomas whom had prior experience.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/Nobi_Patch.jpg" class="picClear" alt="" />Nobi Ryu Hajutsu is a system of Japanese swordsmanship that focuses on the use of the katana/ shinobi katana or ninjato (the straight blade) and the naginata. Originally it was named Nobi Ryu Kenjutsu until Soke John Thacker was asked by a student who saw him practicing with a naginata if he could learn that weapon as well. Students may either focus on just the sword or naginata or study both. Those students focusing on only the sword are required to learn some requirements for the naginata for the 5th Dan. Those studying just the naginata will be required to likewise learn specific requirements with the sword to achieve the 5th Dan. The switch to Hajutsu is to signify the art of the cutting edge or blade.  Nobi Ryu Hajutsu is based on the arts of Shorin Ryu Matsubayashi and Ninpo Kenjutsu.
